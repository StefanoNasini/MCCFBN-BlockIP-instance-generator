# MCCFBN-BlockIP-instance-generator
MCCFBN-BlockIP is a specialized interior-point algorithm for the solution of minimum cost convex flow problems in bipartite networks, based on the BlockIP solver. MCCFBN-BlockIP is an original idea of Jordi Castro and Stefano Nasini. The algorithm is mainly appropriate for huge unbalanced network problems (e.g., hundreds of millions of arcs, with significantly more nodes in one partition of the nodes than the other). This link contains the C++ source code for the generation of OD pairs and transportation costs for the network flow problems in bipartite network.
